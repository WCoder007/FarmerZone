																<p> I am a 3rd year BTech student at IIT Mandi pursuing a project under Dr. Srikant Srinivasan on Machine Learning. I have been given a dataset having information on Distribution of Yield across various years in various parts of Iowa, USA. The data also talks about the various seed brands, varieties and weather conditions in the locality. The aim of the project is to apply various <b>machine learning models to predict the yield</b> in the forthcoming years based on relevant factors and see the trends across various domains. Currently I have applied Naive Bayes model for classifying a brand into a specific yield region based on the brand’s performance in the past years. In future, I will be finding the most relevant factor that affects the yield by taking into account weather conditions also.</p>

																<!-- <b>B.Tech. </b>, ECE, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, (2003) <br /><br /> 
																<p> I am a 2nd Year student at IIT Mandi. During my summer vacations after 1st year, I started working with Prof. Srikant Srinivasan on <b>Machine Learning</b>. I started by reading and studying about various machine learning techniques, their implementations and their algorithms. Now I work on an agricultural dataset on corn plants with their different features in different environments belonging to different species. Data cleaning was done on the dataset, fixing missing values using regression techniques and mean values, along with removal of outliers. The main task was to find some scientific correlation in the dataset. I investigated the effect of environment on different traits. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, Isomap, tSNE have been used on the dataset and the results are being observed to derive a correlation between different traits and effect of the plant genotype on its features. Future goals include establishing the aforementioned relationships with scientific basis, determination of high yielding plant families and a deeper understanding of tSNE and PCA.</p>
